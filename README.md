# Ricing yer system

You know those awesome crunchy, sharp rices, with incredible
tasty sauces, so tasty you can feel the intensity of
its greatness inside your soul? Well, although I do like
rice, I'm not actually talking about
[this](http://i.imgur.com/n3pz44B.png). I'm here to lead you
to the sagred palace of unix ricing, the supreme art of transforming
your trivial computer system into a powerful, useful and beautiful
place of work.

First of all, I have some considerations here. This is
a book on how to understand the parts of your system,
and make use of them to customize it the way you please.
Another thing is: you won't find about GUIs anywhere in here.
That's primarily because GUIs aren't *standardized* or equal
on all systems. Terminals are, however, and it's a fair
reason for me to only take CLIs (Command Line Interface)
and TUI (Terminal User Interface) into account.

Don't be afraid of the terminal, my little reptile dragonfly.
This book will teach you the wisdom of unix systems, no knowledge
is wasteful. Although I believe GUIs are important to a lot of
people, using the terminal might be a good experience for those who opt
out of using it. You'll understand why we use it so much. One of the
reasons was said already, but for clarity: it's a standardized place
on all systems; if it is POSIX compliant, then I can use my knowledge
everywhere, no matter what distribution or *unix-like variant* I'm using.
I don't rely on GUIs, and that's a good thing, fairly because
I can perform the same work, using the tools I'm already
used to, on any system.

And this is one of the reasons ricing becomes sort of a common work.
Mainly, the same files and tools I'm using in the book, will be
the same ones you are going to use. Isn't that great?

## Summary

I don't have a summary yet, but I'll provide one once this
book gets some more pages.

## Donating

I hadn't thought of profiting from it, but someone asked me if there
was any way people could donate if they wanted to. So if you're feeling
quite kind today, you may donate to this bitcoin wallet:

I'd be grateful.

Oh, and if you feel like helping me on writing content to this
book, just send me a PR, or send me an email, or whatever.
