# Ricing yer system

You know those awesome crunchy, sharp rices, with incredible
tasty sauces, so tasty you can feel the intensity of
its greatness inside your soul? Well, although I do like
rice, I'm not talking about actual
[rice](http://i.imgur.com/n3pz44B.png). I'm here to lead you
to the sacred palace of unix ricing, the supreme art of transforming
your trivial computer system into a powerful, useful and beautiful
place.

Some things to consider, however:

* This is a book on how to understand the parts of your system,
and use them to customize it as you please.

* You won't find anything related to GUIs in here.
That's primarily because GUIs aren't *standardized* or equal
on all systems. Terminals are. And for this fair reason
I'm only going to take CLIs (Command Line Interface)
and TUI (Terminal User Interface) into account.

Don't be afraid of the terminal, my little reptile dragonfly!
This book will teach you the wisdom of unix systems, no knowledge
is wasteful. Although GUIs are important to a lot of
people, using the terminal is a good experience for those who opt
out of using it. This leads you to understand why we use it so much.
One reason was already mentioned, let's rephrase for
clarity: it's a standardized place
on all systems; if it is POSIX compliant, then I can use my CLI knowledge
there, no matter the distribution or *unix-like variant*.
Not relying on GUIs is a good thing because the same tasks
can be performed using the same tools I'm already
used to, on _any_ system.

The same files and tools you're gonna see along this book,
are gonna be usable by any of you, readers.  
Isn't that great?

## Summary

I don't have a summary yet, but I'll provide one once this
book gets some more pages.

## Donating

I hadn't thought of profiting from it, but someone asked me if there
was any way people could donate if they wanted to. So if you're feeling
quite kind today, you may donate to this bitcoin wallet:

I'd be grateful.

Oh, and if you feel like helping me on writing content to this
book, just send me a PR, or send me an email, or whatever.
